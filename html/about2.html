            Reputation (Taylor's Version) is the 5th re-recorded album by Taylor Swift. It was released on November 13, 2024, through Republic Records.<br>
            Inspired by Swift's romantic relationships and tarnished media image caused by celebrity disputes, the songs on Reputation altogether form a<br> 
            linear narrative about a protagonist expressing anger and vengeance against wrongdoers and finding solace in a blossoming love. A feud with<br>
            the rapper Kanye West and the media personality Kim Kardashian over West's song "Famous", in which he claims he made Swift a success<br> 
            ("I made that bitch famous"), was controversial. Although Swift said she never consented to the said lyric, Kardashian released a 
            phone recording<br> between Swift and West, in which the former seemingly consented to another portion of the song. In 2020, the phone recording was proven to
            <br>be edited to create controversy about Swift when the full transcript was leaked.
        </p>
        <p align="justify" style=" margin-left: 12cm;">
            During seclusion from public appearances, Swift wrote Reputation as a "defense mechanism" against the rampant media scrutiny targeting her <br>
            and a means to revamp her state of mind. She said in a 2019 Rolling Stone interview that she followed the songwriting for her 2014 single<br> 
            "Blank Space", which satirizes the criticism targeting her for dating "too many people" in her twenties, and wrote Reputation from the perspective<br> 
            of a character that others believed her to be. In a 2023 Time interview, she described the album's creation as "a goth-punk moment of female rage<br> 
            at being gaslit by an entire social structure.
